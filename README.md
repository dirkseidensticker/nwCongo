The study provides a comprehensive analysis of archaeological findings
from the north-western Congo Basin that were discovered in 1985 and
1987. An inventory of 122 sites and approximately 10,500 objects, mostly
ceramic vessels or individual sherds, were examined.

## Summary

The study’s main objectives were to develop a spatio-temporal reference
framework for the area based on pottery groups derived from the
technological, formal, and ornamental characteristics of the ceramics
(chapter 4) and to provide an archaeological synthesis of the available
knowledge on the settlement history of the Congo Basin (chapter 5). In
addition to stylistic characterizations, the studied ceramics were
analyzed regarding fabrication techniques and technology (chapter 3).
Fabrics, which reflect processing of clays during potting, were
systematically recorded. Macroscopic traces of manufacturing techniques
were examined within a representative sample (chapter 3.1) and three
independent technology traditions could be identified (chapter 5.3).
